A mod that makes it easier to find the lobbies you want.

## Features
- Sort lobbies by distance, just like in versions prior to 1.11
- Toggle the filtering of swear words in lobby names with the chat filter settings
- Filter lobbies by their physical distance

## Additional information
The quality of this mod's logo matches the quality of the mod itself. I am surprised it works at all.
